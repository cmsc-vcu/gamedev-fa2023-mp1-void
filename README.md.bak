Collecting stars gives a points multiplier
Fewer shots = better score
The black hole will suck you in if you get too close, but can also be used to curve your shots if you're brave enough!
Can you get a 3-star hole in one?

Changes since last time: 
- Added a new background (Natalie)
- Prevented player from spawning inside black hole radius (Tristan)
